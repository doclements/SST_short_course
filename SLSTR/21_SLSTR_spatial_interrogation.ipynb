    "We can see from the bias and standard deviation plots that there are some sharp lines across the image. SLSTR uses 5 algorithms to estimate SST. Some of these algorithms use the nadir view only, while some take advantage of the 'Dual View' capability of the sensor. Dual view takes two images of the surface, one at nadir and one at an oblique angle. This allows it to better characterise the effects of the atmosphere. In practice, the nadir view is wider than the dual view, which results in a stripe along the middle of the swath. We can check which algorithms were used to derive the SST estimate by checking the SST_ALG_TYPE variable, as below:"
